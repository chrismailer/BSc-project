# RARL Hexapod Python Simulator

A dynamical simulation of the RARL Hexapod platform using the [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) physics engine. This simulation was used along with the IT&E adaptation algorithm (Cully et al. 2015) to enable adaptation on the Hexapod platform. The file `example.py` provides and example implementation of running a simulation.
